        <!-- Title -->
        <h1 class="text-3xl font-bold mb-8">Invoice vs. Receipt: What's the Difference?</h1>

        <!-- Introduction -->
        <p class="text-lg mb-8">Invoices and receipts are both important documents that serve as records of financial
            transactions. However, there are key differences between the two.</p>

        <!-- Invoices Section -->
        <h2 class="text-xl font-semibold mb-4">Invoices</h2>
        <p class="mb-4">An invoice is a document that a seller sends to a buyer to request payment for goods or services
            that have been sold. It typically includes the following information:</p>
        <ul class="list-disc pl-6 mb-4">
            <li>The seller's name and contact information</li>
            <li>The buyer's name and contact information</li>
            <li>The date of the transaction</li>
            <li>A description of the goods or services sold</li>
            <li>The quantity of goods or services sold</li>
            <li>The price per unit of goods or services</li>
            <li>The total amount due</li>
        </ul>
        <p class="mb-8">Invoices are often used for business-to-business (B2B) transactions. They can also be used for
            business-to-consumer (B2C) transactions, but this is less common.</p>

        <!-- Receipts Section -->
        <h2 class="text-xl font-semibold mb-4">Receipts</h2>
        <p class="mb-4">A receipt is a document that a seller gives to a buyer to acknowledge that payment has been
            received for goods or services that have been sold. It typically includes the following information:</p>
        <ul class="list-disc pl-6 mb-4">
            <li>The seller's name and contact information</li>
            <li>The buyer's name and contact information</li>
            <li>The date of the transaction</li>
            <li>A description of the goods or services sold</li>
            <li>The quantity of goods or services sold</li>
            <li>The price per unit of goods or services</li>
            <li>The total amount paid</li>
        </ul>
        <p class="mb-8">Receipts are often used for B2C transactions. They can also be used for B2B transactions, but
            this is less common.</p>

        <!-- Main Differences Section -->
        <h2 class="text-xl font-semibold mb-4">The Difference Between Invoices and Receipts</h2>
        <p class="mb-8">The main difference between an invoice and a receipt is that an invoice is a request for
            payment, while a receipt is an acknowledgment of payment. Invoices are typically used before payment is
            made, while receipts are typically used after payment is made.</p>

        <!-- Other Differences Section -->
        <h2 class="text-xl font-semibold mb-4">Other Differences</h2>
        <p class="mb-8">There are a few other differences between invoices and receipts. Invoices are typically more
            formal documents than receipts. They may also include additional information, such as the terms of payment
            or the seller's tax ID number. Receipts are typically less formal documents. They may only include the basic
            information about the transaction.</p>

        <!-- When to Use Invoice Section -->
        <h2 class="text-xl font-semibold mb-4">When to Use an Invoice</h2>
        <p class="mb-8">You should use an invoice when you are selling goods or services to a business or another
            individual and you need to request payment.</p>

        <!-- When to Use Receipt Section -->
        <h2 class="text-xl font-semibold mb-4">When to Use a Receipt</h2>
        <p class="mb-8">You should use a receipt when you have sold goods or services to a customer and you need to
            acknowledge that payment has been received.</p>

        <!-- Conclusion Section -->
        <h2 class="text-xl font-semibold mb-4">Conclusion</h2>
        <p class="mb-8">Invoices and receipts are both important documents that serve different purposes. It is
            important to understand the difference between the two so that you can use the correct document for each
            transaction.</p>
