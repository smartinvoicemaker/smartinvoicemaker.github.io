    <h1>Invoice vs. Receipt: What's the Difference?</h1>

    <p>Invoices and receipts are both important documents that serve as records of financial transactions. However, there are key differences between the two.</p>

    <h2>Invoices</h2>

    <p>An invoice is a document that a seller sends to a buyer to request payment for goods or services that have been sold. It typically includes the following information:</p>

    <ul>
        <li>The seller's name and contact information</li>
        <li>The buyer's name and contact information</li>
        <li>The date of the transaction</li>
        <li>A description of the goods or services sold</li>
        <li>The quantity of goods or services sold</li>
        <li>The price per unit of goods or services</li>
        <li>The total amount due</li>
    </ul>

    <p>Invoices are often used for business-to-business (B2B) transactions. They can also be used for business-to-consumer (B2C) transactions, but this is less common.</p>

    <h2>Receipts</h2>

    <p>A receipt is a document that a seller gives to a buyer to acknowledge that payment has been received for goods or services that have been sold. It typically includes the following information:</p>

    <ul>
        <li>The seller's name and contact information</li>
        <li>The buyer's name and contact information</li>
        <li>The date of the transaction</li>
        <li>A description of the goods or services sold</li>
        <li>The quantity of goods or services sold</li>
        <li>The price per unit of goods or services</li>
        <li>The total amount paid</li>
    </ul>

    <p>Receipts are often used for B2C transactions. They can also be used for B2B transactions, but this is less common.</p>

    <h2>The Difference Between Invoices and Receipts</h2>

    <p>The main difference between an invoice and a receipt is that an invoice is a request for payment, while a receipt is an acknowledgment of payment. Invoices are typically used before payment is made, while receipts are typically used after payment is made.</p>

    <h2>Other Differences</h2>

    <p>There are a few other differences between invoices and receipts. Invoices are typically more formal documents than receipts. They may also include additional information, such as the terms of payment or the seller's tax ID number. Receipts are typically less formal documents. They may only include the basic information about the transaction.</p>

    <h2>When to Use an Invoice</h2>

    <p>You should use an invoice when you are selling goods or services to a business or another individual and you need to request payment.</p>

    <h2>When to Use a Receipt</h2>

    <p>You should use a receipt when you have sold goods or services to a customer and you need to acknowledge that payment has been received.</p>

    <h2>Conclusion</h2>

    <p>Invoices and receipts are both important documents that serve different purposes. It is important to understand the difference between the two so that you can use the correct document for each transaction.</p>
