    <h2>Disclaimer And Non-Waiver of Rights</h2>
    <p>Invoice App makes no guarantees, representations or warranties of any kind as regards the website and associated technology. Any purportedly applicable warranties, terms and conditions are excluded, to the fullest extent permitted by law. Your use of the Service is at your sole risk. The Service is provided on an “AS IS” and “AS AVAILABLE” basis. The Service is provided without warranties of any kind, whether express or implied, including, but not limited to, implied warranties of merchantability, fitness for a particular purpose, non-infringement, or course of performance, except as provided for under the laws of any province in Canada.

Invoice App does not waive any of its rights. Invoice App shall not be responsible for any purported breach of these Terms caused by circumstances beyond its control. A person who is not a party to these Terms shall have no rights of enforcement. You may not assign, sub-license or otherwise transfer any of your rights under these Terms.</p>

    <h2>Exclusions</h2>
    <p>As set out, above, some jurisdictions do not allow the exclusion of certain warranties or the exclusion or limitation of liability for consequential or incidental damages, so the limitations above may not apply to you. Substantive law of Australia may apply to certain products and service provided.</p>

    <h2>Governing Law</h2>
    <p>These Terms shall be governed by, and interpreted and enforced in accordance with, the laws in the Substantive law of Australia, as applicable. If any provision of these Terms is held to be invalid or unenforceable by a court of competent jurisdiction, then any remaining provisions of these Terms will remain in effect. These Terms constitute the entire agreement between us regarding our Service, and supersede and replace any prior agreements, oral or otherwise, regarding the Service.</p>

    <h2>Changes</h2>
    <p>We reserve the right, at our sole discretion, to modify or replace these Terms at any time. If a revision is material, we will make reasonable efforts to provide at least 30 days’ notice prior to any new terms taking effect. What constitutes a material change will be determined at our sole discretion. By continuing to access or use our Service after those revisions become effective, you agree to be bound by the revised terms. If you do not agree to the new terms, in whole or in part, please stop using the website and the Service.</p>
